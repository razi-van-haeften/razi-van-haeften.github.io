    <h1 class="main-title">HMA AE2 in the Dardanelles</h1>
    <p class="drama-content">
        On the 28 of June, 1914 Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by Bosnian nationalists.<br>
        This was the spark that would ignite tensions between Europe's greatest powers, initiating the Great War- <br>
        A war in which killing was industrialised, mechanised.<br>

        It would burn not only the continent<br>
        but the entire world.

    <h1 class="section-title">Why was the Dardanelles Strait an important strategic target</h1>
    <p class="content">
        World War 1 featured 2 main opposing alliances, the <b>Allies</b> and the <b>Central Powers</b>.&nbsp
        The Allies were initially composed of France, Russia, and the British Empire. Italy and the United States joined in later years.&nbsp 
        The Central Powers consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire.&nbsp
        In early 1915, Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander of the Russian armies requested aid from the British Empire in the hope that they would help relieve them of Turkish resistence in Armenia.&nbsp
        The German Imperial Army had previously won a major victory at the Battle of Tannenberg in East Prussia, forcing the Russians downwards into the Caucasus where they were vulnerable to Turkish forces.&nbsp
        Controlling the Dardenelles Strait would enable reliable communications with Russia as well as the re-opening of shipping routes.&nbsp
